Define service routes

Author's Note:
    For a small service having one route.py module works. However for larger
    projects we will want to break up where we define our endpoints. An example
    file structure that could work:
        /app
            /v1
                /endpoints
                    /health_check.py
                    /profile.py
                    /etc ...
                /utils
                /<any other appropriate dir related to v1>
            /v2
                /...
    This structure would allow us to:
        1) More easly organize/group our endpoints based http resource
        2) Sets up a structure that will be easier to navigate as new service
            versions are created.
        3) We can use Python introspection to define endpoints URIs, so clients
            would hit something like: '/v1/profile/<org_name>'. This has the
            advantage of allowing our service to support multiple API
            versions at the same time. This would be VERY handy especially when
            transitioning the service to a new API version. Endpoints can be
            transitioned and tested without sunsetting older versions.
